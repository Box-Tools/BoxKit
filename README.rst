Introduction
------------

BoxKit is a library that provides building blocks to parallelize and
scale data science, high performance computing, and machine learning
applications for block-structured spatial datasets. 

Spatial data from simulations and experiments can be organized and managed using the tools available in this library. 

The library is designed into two broad categories:

**CREATE** - contains classes/structures to store spatial data in a rectangular/cubic frame, along with auxillary tools to manage irregular geometries composed of unstructured triangular mesh.

**UTILITIES** - contains classes/structures to improve memory managment of data on NUMA nodes.

This library is designed to facilitate the use of scientific datasets with more data analysis oriented packages.
